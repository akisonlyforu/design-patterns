<h3>Behavioral Design Pattern</h3>
Behavioral patterns describe interactions between objects and focus on how objects communicate with
 each other. Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
 . Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. 
 That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
