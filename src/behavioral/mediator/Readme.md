# Mediator Pattern

## What is Mediator Pattern?

Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines object encapsulating how a set of other objects interact with one another. It restricts direct communications between objects and forces them to collaborate via mediator, hence reducing dependencies between them. The pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and letting you vary their interaction independently.

## Purpose

- Define how set of objects interact without them referring to each other explicitly
- Encapsulate complex communications and control logic between related objects
- Promote loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other directly
- Centralize complex communications and control logic in one place
- Allow interaction behavior to be varied independently from participating objects
- Make object interactions easier to understand, maintain, and extend
- Support reuse of individual components in different contexts

## Structure

The pattern consists of:
- **Mediator Interface** - Defines contract for communication between components
- **Concrete Mediator** - Implements mediator interface and coordinates communication between components
- **Component Classes** - Contain reference to mediator and communicate through it instead of directly
- **Client** - Creates mediator and components, sets up their relationships

The pattern relies on centralized communication and composition. Components hold reference to mediator and delegate all inter-component communication to it.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Coupling** - Components don't need direct references to each other
- **Centralized Control** - All interaction logic concentrated in mediator
- **Reusability** - Components can be reused in different contexts with different mediators
- **Easier Maintenance** - Changes to interaction logic made in one place (mediator)
- **Simplified Communication** - Complex many-to-many relationships become one-to-many
- **Extensibility** - New components can be added without changing existing ones

## When to Use

- When set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways
- When reusing object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
- When behavior distributed between several classes should be customizable without subclassing
- When you want to avoid tight coupling between interacting objects
- When complex communication protocols need to be centralized and managed
- When you need to coordinate interactions between multiple objects

## Example Scenario

A system where multiple components need to coordinate their activities through centralized control mechanism. Instead of components communicating directly with each other (creating complex dependencies), they communicate through a mediator that handles all coordination logic and manages the interactions between components.

## Real-World Applications

- **Air Traffic Control Systems** - Aircraft coordinate takeoffs/landings through control tower
- **Chat Room Applications** - Users send messages through chat room mediator
- **GUI Dialog Boxes** - Form controls interact through dialog controller
- **Workflow Management Systems** - Tasks coordinate through workflow engine
- **Game Development** - Game objects coordinate through game manager
- **Microservice Orchestration** - Services communicate through service orchestrator
- **Event-Driven Architectures** - Components communicate through event bus
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Agents coordinate through central coordinator

## Pattern Variations

### Basic Mediator
- Simple mediator that forwards messages between components
- Minimal coordination logic

### Coordinator Mediator
- Complex mediator with sophisticated coordination algorithms
- Manages state and makes decisions about component interactions

### Event-Based Mediator
- Mediator that uses event-driven communication
- Components publish events, mediator routes to appropriate handlers

### Hierarchical Mediator
- Multiple mediators organized in hierarchy
- Local mediators handle specific subsystems, global mediator coordinates overall

## Implementation Guidelines

### Do's
- Keep mediator focused on coordination logic, not business logic
- Make components unaware of each other's existence
- Centralize complex interaction protocols in mediator
- Consider using observer pattern within mediator for event handling
- Document interaction protocols clearly

### Don'ts
- Don't put business logic in mediator - keep it in components
- Don't create overly complex mediators that become hard to maintain
- Don't make components dependent on specific mediator implementations
- Don't forget to handle edge cases in coordination logic
- Don't create circular dependencies between mediator and components

## Performance Considerations

### Communication Overhead
- Mediator adds indirection to component communication
- Consider performance impact for high-frequency interactions
- Use efficient data structures for component management

### Scalability
- Large numbers of components may stress mediator
- Consider partitioning strategies for very large systems
- Monitor mediator performance as bottleneck point

### Memory Usage
- Mediator may need to store significant state about components
- Consider cleanup strategies for removed components
- Avoid memory leaks from component references

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

- **God Object Mediator**: Keep mediator focused on coordination, not everything
- **Component Dependencies**: Ensure components truly don't know about each other
- **Mediator Complexity**: Don't let mediator become overly complex monolith
- **State Management**: Properly manage mediator state and component lifecycle
- **Communication Protocols**: Clearly define and document interaction protocols

## Testing Strategy

The tests verify:
- **Component isolation** - Components don't communicate directly
- **Mediator coordination** - Mediator properly manages component interactions
- **State management** - Mediator maintains correct system state
- **Conflict resolution** - Mediator handles conflicting requests appropriately
- **Dynamic membership** - Components can be added/removed from system
- **Communication protocols** - Different message types handled correctly

## Thread Safety Considerations

### Concurrent Access
- Mediator may be accessed by multiple components simultaneously
- Use appropriate synchronization for mediator state
- Consider thread-safe collections for component management

### Component Communication
- Ensure thread-safe communication protocols
- Handle concurrent notifications to mediator
- Consider message queuing for asynchronous processing

### State Consistency
- Maintain consistent mediator state under concurrent access
- Use atomic operations for critical state changes
- Consider using immutable state objects where possible

## Modern Applications

### Microservices Architecture
- Service mesh as mediator for service communication
- API gateways coordinating client-service interactions
- Event buses managing cross-service communication

### Event-Driven Systems
- Event sourcing with mediator as event coordinator
- CQRS with mediator handling command/query separation
- Reactive systems with mediator managing data flows

### Cloud Computing
- Load balancers as mediators for request distribution
- Service discovery as mediator for service location
- Container orchestrators managing container interactions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### God Mediator
- **Problem**: Mediator becomes overly complex and handles everything
- **Solution**: Keep mediator focused on specific coordination responsibilities

### Chatty Mediator
- **Problem**: Too much communication overhead through mediator
- **Solution**: Optimize communication protocols and consider direct communication where appropriate

### Leaky Abstraction
- **Problem**: Components start depending on mediator implementation details
- **Solution**: Maintain clean mediator interface and hide implementation

## Alternatives to Consider

### For Simple Interactions
- **Direct Communication**: When interaction is simple and unlikely to change
- **Observer Pattern**: When you need one-to-many notifications without complex coordination

### For Complex Systems
- **Event Bus**: When you need more sophisticated event routing
- **Publish-Subscribe**: When you need decoupled messaging with topic-based routing
- **Actor Model**: When you need distributed coordination with message passing

## Conclusion

The Mediator pattern provides elegant solution for managing complex object interactions by centralizing communication logic in dedicated mediator objects. It excels in scenarios requiring sophisticated coordination between multiple objects while maintaining loose coupling. The pattern's ability to encapsulate interaction protocols makes systems more maintainable and extensible, though care must be taken to prevent the mediator itself from becoming overly complex.
