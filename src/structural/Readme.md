<h3>Structural Design Pattern </h3>

Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to
 realize relationships between entities. They are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger
  structures. These patterns focus on how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other
   classes. Types of Structural Patterns:
