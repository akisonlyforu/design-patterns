<h3>Creational Design Pattern</h3>
 These patterns deal with how Objects are created. You do not have to write large, complex code to
 instantiate an object. It does this by having the subclass of the class create the objects. The new operator is often 
 considered harmful as it scatters objects all over the application. Over time it can become challenging to change an 
 implementation because classes become tightly coupled. Creational Design Patterns address this issue by decoupling
  the client entirely from the implementation process. Types of Creational Patterns:
 <ul>
 <li>Builder Pattern</li>
 <li>Prototype Pattern</li>
 <li>Singleton Pattern</li>
 <li>Object Pool Pattern</li>
 <li>Factory Pattern</li>
 <li>Abstract Factory Pattern</li>
 </ul>
